## IF4Health Projects Overview

Regarding the number of IF4Health collaborators increasing, we needed to group our development in this Organization Repository. We understand the IF4Health projects must be in a repository belonging to the research group instead of personal repositories.

We chose the electrocardiogram (ECG) as the first case study. The figure overviews the IF4Health repos and how they are connected. Soon, we will expand to other biosignals.
